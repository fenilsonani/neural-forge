### ‚è±Ô∏è Response Timeline

We will acknowledge your report within **48 hours** and provide a detailed response within **7 days** indicating:
- Confirmation of the issue
- Our planned timeline for addressing it
- Any additional information needed

### üéØ Scope

This security policy applies to vulnerabilities in:

#### ‚úÖ In Scope
- **Core tensor operations** that could lead to memory corruption
- **File I/O operations** that could enable directory traversal or file system access
- **Network operations** in distributed training that could enable remote code execution
- **Serialization/deserialization** that could enable code injection
- **CUDA/GPU operations** that could cause system instability
- **Memory management** issues that could lead to information disclosure
- **Input validation** bypasses that could lead to crashes or unexpected behavior

#### ‚ùå Out of Scope
- **Denial of Service** through resource exhaustion (unless it leads to system compromise)
- **Issues requiring physical access** to the machine
- **Vulnerabilities in dependencies** (please report to the respective projects)
- **Theoretical attacks** without practical proof of concept
- **Self-XSS** or similar issues requiring user interaction to exploit themselves

### üèÜ Recognition

We believe in recognizing security researchers who help make Neural Forge more secure:

#### Acknowledgments
- We maintain a **Security Hall of Fame** for researchers who report valid vulnerabilities
- With your permission, we'll acknowledge your contribution in our security advisories
- We may reference your research in our documentation (with your consent)

#### Responsible Disclosure
We follow responsible disclosure practices:
1. **Private report** received and acknowledged
2. **Investigation and fix** development (with regular updates to reporter)
3. **Security release** with fix deployed
4. **Public disclosure** of the vulnerability details (after fix is widely available)
5. **Credit given** to the researcher (if desired)

### üîß Security Best Practices for Users

#### For Developers
```python
# ‚úÖ Good: Validate input tensors
def safe_operation(tensor):
    if not isinstance(tensor, Tensor):
        raise TypeError("Expected Tensor input")
    if tensor.shape[0] > MAX_ALLOWED_SIZE:
        raise ValueError("Tensor too large")
    return process(tensor)

# ‚ùå Bad: No input validation
def unsafe_operation(tensor):
    return process(tensor)  # Could crash with invalid input
```

#### For Production Deployments
- **Keep Neural Forge updated** to the latest stable version
- **Validate all inputs** before processing with Neural Forge
- **Run with minimal privileges** - don't run training as root
- **Monitor resource usage** to detect potential DoS attempts
- **Use secure file permissions** for model checkpoints and data
- **Sanitize file paths** when loading/saving models

#### For Model Serving
```python
# ‚úÖ Good: Secure model loading
def load_model_safely(model_path):
    # Validate path is in allowed directory
    safe_path = validate_path(model_path)
    # Load with size limits
    return load_model(safe_path, max_size=MAX_MODEL_SIZE)

# ‚ùå Bad: Unsafe model loading
def load_model_unsafely(model_path):
    return load_model(model_path)  # Could load from anywhere
```

### üö® Known Security Considerations

#### Tensor Operations
- **Large tensor allocation** can cause out-of-memory conditions
- **Invalid shapes** in operations can cause crashes
- **Numerical overflow** in computations can lead to unexpected behavior

#### File I/O
- **Model serialization** uses pickle by default - only load trusted models
- **Data loading** should validate file paths and sizes
- **Checkpoint files** may contain arbitrary Python code

#### Memory Management
- **GPU memory** allocation failures can crash the process
- **Memory leaks** in long-running training can exhaust system resources
- **Shared memory** in distributed training needs proper access controls

### üìö Security Resources

#### Internal Security Measures
- **Automated security scanning** in CI/CD pipeline
- **Dependency vulnerability monitoring** with automated updates
- **Code review requirements** for all changes
- **Static analysis** to catch common vulnerabilities
- **Fuzzing tests** for input validation

#### External Resources
- [OWASP Machine Learning Security Top 10](https://owasp.org/www-project-machine-learning-security-top-10/)
- [NIST AI Risk Management Framework](https://www.nist.gov/itl/ai-risk-management-framework)
- [Python Security Best Practices](https://python-security.readthedocs.io/)

### üîÑ Security Updates

We will:
- **Monitor dependencies** for known vulnerabilities
- **Release security patches** promptly for confirmed issues
- **Maintain security changelog** documenting all security-related changes
- **Provide migration guides** when security fixes require API changes

### üìû Contact Information

For non-security related issues:
- **GitHub Issues**: [Issues Page](https://github.com/fenilsonani/neural-forge/issues)
- **General Questions**: Use GitHub Discussions

For security concerns:
- **Security Email**: fenil.sonani@example.com (GPG key available upon request)
- **Emergency Contact**: Include "[URGENT SECURITY]" in subject line

### üìÑ Legal

This security policy is provided in good faith to encourage responsible disclosure of security vulnerabilities. We reserve the right to:
- Modify this policy at any time
- Determine the validity and scope of reported vulnerabilities
- Choose our response timeline based on severity and complexity

We will not pursue legal action against security researchers who:
- Report vulnerabilities in good faith according to this policy
- Make a good faith effort to avoid privacy violations and data destruction
- Do not exploit vulnerabilities beyond what is necessary to demonstrate the issue
