# Check CUDA version
nvidia-smi

# Install matching CuPy version
pip install cupy-cuda11x  # for CUDA 11.x
pip install cupy-cuda12x  # for CUDA 12.x
```

**Numba JIT Issues**

# JIT backend is experimental and may have compatibility issues
# Framework automatically falls back to NumPy if Numba fails
python -c "
from neural_arch.backends import available_backends
print('Working backends:', available_backends())
"
```

**MLX not working on Apple Silicon**
```bash
# Ensure you're on macOS with Apple Silicon
pip install --upgrade mlx>=0.5.0

# Test MLX separately
python -c "import mlx.core as mx; print('MLX version:', mx.__version__)"
```

**Import Errors**
```bash
# Ensure you're in the right directory and using editable install
cd neural-network-from-scratch
pip install -e .

# Check Python path
python -c "import sys; print(sys.path)"
```

## Quick Start

### Basic Tensor Operations
```python
from neural_arch.core import Tensor
from neural_arch.functional import matmul

# Create tensors with automatic differentiation
a = Tensor([[1, 2], [3, 4]], requires_grad=True)
b = Tensor([[5, 6], [7, 8]], requires_grad=True)

# Perform operations
c = matmul(a, b)
loss = c.sum()

# Compute gradients
loss.backward()
print(f"Gradient of a: {a.grad}")
```

### Simple Neural Network
```python
from neural_arch.nn import Linear, ReLU
from neural_arch.optim import Adam

# Create a simple network
layer1 = Linear(2, 4)
activation = ReLU()
layer2 = Linear(4, 1)

# Forward pass
x = Tensor([[1, 2]])
h = activation(layer1(x))
output = layer2(h)

# Training setup
optimizer = Adam([layer1.weight, layer1.bias, layer2.weight, layer2.bias])
```

### Transformer Example
```python
from neural_arch.nn import MultiHeadAttention, TransformerBlock

# Create transformer components
attention = MultiHeadAttention(d_model=256, num_heads=8)
transformer = TransformerBlock(d_model=256, num_heads=8, d_ff=1024)

# Process sequences
seq_len, batch_size, d_model = 10, 2, 256
x = Tensor.randn(seq_len, batch_size, d_model)
output = transformer(x)
```

### CNN/RNN Examples
```python
from neural_arch.nn import Conv2d, LSTM, GRU, AdaptiveAvgPool2d
from neural_arch.core import Tensor

# Convolutional Neural Network
conv = Conv2d(in_channels=3, out_channels=64, kernel_size=3, padding=1)
pool = AdaptiveAvgPool2d(output_size=(7, 7))
x = Tensor.randn(32, 3, 224, 224)  # Batch of images
features = pool(conv(x))

# Recurrent Neural Network
lstm = LSTM(input_size=100, hidden_size=256, num_layers=2, bidirectional=True)
gru = GRU(input_size=100, hidden_size=128, batch_first=True)
seq = Tensor.randn(32, 10, 100)  # Batch of sequences
lstm_out, (h_n, c_n) = lstm(seq)
gru_out, h_n = gru(seq)
```
