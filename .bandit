# Bandit configuration file to suppress false positives

[bandit]
# Skip tests directory
exclude_dirs = tests,benchmarks

# Skip specific security checks that are false positives for our use case:
# B101: assert statements are used for validation in ML code 
# B110: try/except/pass blocks are used for graceful fallbacks in backends
# B310: urlopen is used for legitimate model downloads with proper validation
# B404: subprocess import is needed for distributed training launcher
# B603: subprocess calls are safe (using sys.executable, no untrusted input)
# B607: subprocess with partial path - we use sys.executable which is safe
