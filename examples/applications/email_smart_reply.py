"""Smart Email Reply Assistant using Differential Attention.

A practical application that helps people write better email responses by:
1. Focusing on key points in the original email (using Differential Attention)
2. Avoiding hallucination/making up information
3. Maintaining appropriate tone and context
4. Being more concise and relevant

This is something everyone can use daily!
