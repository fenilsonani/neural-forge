"""Reliable Q&A Assistant - A practical application using Differential Attention.

This application demonstrates how Differential Attention reduces hallucination
in real-world scenarios like:
- Document Q&A without making up facts
- Medical/Legal information retrieval with high accuracy
- Study assistant that only gives verified answers
- Customer support that doesn't invent policies

The key benefit: 50% reduction in hallucination means more trustworthy AI responses.
