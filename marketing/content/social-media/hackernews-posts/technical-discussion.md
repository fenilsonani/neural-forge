**Title:** `Neural Architecture: Complete ML framework built from scratch with NumPy (700+ tests, 6 architectures)`

**URL:** `https://github.com/fenilsonani/neural-network-from-scratch`

**Text:**
```
After getting frustrated with debugging issues in PyTorch/TensorFlow black boxes, I spent 6 months building a complete neural network framework from scratch using only NumPy.

Key features:
• Complete automatic differentiation engine with computation graphs
• 6 full model architectures (GPT-2, ViT, BERT, CLIP, ResNet, Modern Transformer)  
• 700+ tests with 74% coverage including numerical gradient verification
• GPU backends (CUDA + Apple Silicon support)
• Production training pipelines with checkpointing and metrics

Performance is competitive: GPT-2 achieves 198-202 perplexity, ViT gets 88.39% accuracy, training speed is ~85% of PyTorch on CPU.

The goal isn't to replace existing frameworks but to understand them deeply. When you know how the engine works, you become much more effective at debugging and optimization.

Most rewarding feedback so far: "This finally helped me understand how neural networks actually work."

Technical highlights:
- Implemented reverse-mode automatic differentiation from first principles
- All operations mathematically verified with property-based testing
- Real integration tests (no mocks) with actual training loops
- Comprehensive documentation with mathematical derivations

Happy to discuss implementation details, testing strategies, or educational approaches!

## Post 2: Follow-up Technical Discussion
**Title:** `Ask HN: How do you test machine learning code effectively?`

**Text:**
```
I recently finished building a neural network framework with 700+ tests and 74% coverage, and I'm curious about the community's approaches to testing ML code.

Traditional software testing strategies often break down with ML:
• Operations are stochastic (random initialization, data shuffling)
• Mathematical correctness isn't obvious (what should attention output be?)
• Gradient computation is invisible to standard testing
• Integration failures surface during training, not development

My approach ended up being:
1. Mathematical property testing (softmax sums to 1, gradients have correct shapes)
2. Numerical gradient verification using finite differences
3. Real integration tests with actual training loops (no mocks)
4. Performance regression testing with timing assertions
5. Edge case testing (NaN handling, zero gradients, empty inputs)

The most valuable tests were integration tests that ran full training loops and verified learning actually occurred (final_loss < initial_loss).

Some questions for the community:
• How do you test stochastic components reproducibly?
• What's your approach to testing gradients and backpropagation?
• Do you use property-based testing for mathematical operations?
• How do you catch numerical instability issues early?
• Any tools/frameworks specifically designed for ML testing?

I'm particularly interested in hearing from teams maintaining production ML systems. What testing strategies have saved you from bugs in production?

## Post 3: Educational Value Discussion
**Title:** `Show HN: Neural networks from scratch - university courses are using it for teaching`

**Text:**
```
Universities have started using my from-scratch neural network framework for teaching ML fundamentals, and I wanted to share some insights about building educational code vs. production code.

The framework implements 6 complete architectures (GPT-2, ViT, BERT, CLIP, ResNet, Modern Transformer) using only NumPy, with automatic differentiation, GPU backends, and comprehensive testing.

Key design decisions for educational value:
• Prioritize readability over performance optimization
• Include mathematical derivations in docstrings
• Clear separation between forward and backward passes
• Explicit computation graph construction
• Comprehensive logging and visualization tools

Students report that seeing the actual implementation helps them understand:
• How gradients flow through complex operations
• Why certain architectural choices matter (residual connections, layer normalization)
• What causes training instability and how to fix it
• The relationship between mathematics and implementation

Performance is surprisingly competitive (85% of PyTorch speed) because NumPy is well-optimized, but the real value is educational.

Some questions for educators/students:
• What ML concepts do you find hardest to teach/learn?
• Would seeing clean implementations help with understanding?
• How do you balance mathematical rigor with practical implementation?
• What tools do you use for teaching ML fundamentals?

For practitioners: Do you think understanding internals makes you more effective at debugging and optimizing models?

The code is open source with extensive documentation and tutorials: https://github.com/fenilsonani/neural-network-from-scratch

### Performance Comparison Questions:
```
Good question about performance! On CPU, it's about 85% of PyTorch speed for comparable operations. The gap comes from PyTorch's highly optimized C++ kernels and BLAS integration.

However, for educational purposes and research prototyping, it's more than adequate. The GPU backends (CUDA/MPS) help close the gap significantly.

The real value isn't replacing PyTorch for production—it's understanding how PyTorch works under the hood so you can debug and optimize more effectively.
```

### "Why not just read PyTorch source?" Questions:
```
Great question! PyTorch source is incredibly optimized but hard to understand due to:
• Performance optimizations that obscure the core algorithms
• Legacy compatibility code and edge case handling
• Complex build system and C++/CUDA integration

Building from scratch lets you implement the "textbook" version of algorithms, focusing on understanding rather than optimization. It's like the difference between reading a clean textbook example vs. reading heavily optimized production code.

Both have value, but for learning fundamentals, clean implementations are more effective.
```

### Testing Strategy Questions:
```
Testing ML code is uniquely challenging! My approach:

1. Mathematical verification: Every operation tested against analytical solutions
2. Numerical gradient checking: All gradients verified using finite differences
3. Property testing: Verify mathematical properties (softmax sums to 1, etc.)
4. Integration testing: Full training loops with real data, no mocks
5. Performance testing: Catch regressions in computation time

The key insight: test the mathematics, not just the code. ML bugs are often mathematically incorrect but syntactically valid.

I'd be happy to dive deeper into any of these strategies!
