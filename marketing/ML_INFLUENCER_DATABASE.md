## **ðŸ“§ OUTREACH MESSAGE TEMPLATES**

### **Template A: Technical Focus (For Researchers)**
```
Subject: Educational ML Framework - Mathematical Verification Approach

Hi [Name],

I built a comprehensive neural network framework from scratch (53K lines) with mathematical verification of every operation. Given your research on [specific recent work], thought you might find the educational approach interesting.

Technical highlights:
â€¢ 6 complete model architectures (GPT-2, ViT, BERT, CLIP, ResNet, Modern Transformer)
â€¢ Mathematical accuracy verified to 1e-06 error rates
â€¢ 85% of PyTorch performance using pure NumPy
â€¢ 700+ tests with numerical gradient checking
â€¢ Interactive Jupyter notebooks for hands-on learning

The goal is helping students understand ML fundamentals rather than treating frameworks as black boxes. Several universities are evaluating it for coursework.

GitHub: https://github.com/fenilsonani/neural-network-from-scratch
Technical showcase: [link to technical power showcase]

Would love your thoughts on the educational approach!

Best,
Fenil Sonani
```

### **Template B: Educational Focus (For Educators)**
```
Subject: 53K-Line Educational ML Framework - Perfect for Teaching

Hi [Name],

I'm reaching out about a comprehensive neural network framework I built specifically for education. Given your excellent work teaching [specific course/content], thought this might be valuable for your students.

What makes it unique:
â€¢ Complete transparency: Every operation implemented from scratch
â€¢ Mathematical rigor: All gradients verified numerically  
â€¢ Production quality: 53K lines with enterprise features
â€¢ Educational design: Progressive complexity from basics to advanced
â€¢ Interactive demos: Jupyter notebooks with one-click execution

Instead of students treating PyTorch as a black box, they can see exactly how neural networks work at every level - from matrix operations to complete model architectures.

Framework includes: GPT-2, Vision Transformer, BERT, CLIP, ResNet, and Modern Transformer implementations.

GitHub: [link]
Interactive demos: [link]

Happy to provide additional resources or customization for your curriculum needs.

Best regards,
Fenil
```

### **Template C: Industry Focus (For Practitioners)**
```
Subject: Production-Grade ML Framework Built from Scratch (53K Lines)

Hi [Name],

Built what might be the most comprehensive "from scratch" ML framework - 53K lines of production code achieving 85% of PyTorch performance using only NumPy.

Why this matters for industry:
â€¢ Deep understanding enables better debugging of production issues
â€¢ Mathematical transparency allows custom optimizations
â€¢ Educational value for team training and onboarding  
â€¢ Research flexibility without framework constraints

Technical specs:
â€¢ 6 complete model architectures with working training scripts
â€¢ Enterprise features: distributed training, GPU acceleration, CLI tools
â€¢ 700+ comprehensive tests with 74% coverage
â€¢ Mathematical verification of all operations

This bridges the gap between educational materials and production frameworks.

Technical details: [link]

Curious about your thoughts on the approach!

Best,
Fenil
