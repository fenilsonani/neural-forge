Subject: Educational ML Framework for [Course Number] - Complete Implementation from Scratch

Dear Professor [Name],

I'm reaching out regarding a comprehensive neural network framework I built specifically for educational purposes. Given your excellent work teaching [specific course], I thought this might be valuable for your students.

Framework Highlights:
‚Ä¢ 53,000+ lines of production-grade Python code
‚Ä¢ Complete mathematical derivations and explanations  
‚Ä¢ 6 model architectures with working training scripts
‚Ä¢ Numerical verification of all gradients and operations
‚Ä¢ Interactive Jupyter notebooks for hands-on learning

The goal is helping students understand ML from first principles rather than treating frameworks as black boxes. Several universities are already evaluating it for coursework.

Would you be interested in reviewing the materials? Happy to provide additional resources or customization for your specific curriculum needs.

Subject: Developer Builds 53K-Line PyTorch Alternative to Teach AI Fundamentals

Hi [Journalist Name],

I've built what might be the most comprehensive "from scratch" ML framework available - 53,000+ lines of production code that achieves 85% of PyTorch performance using only NumPy.

The story goes beyond just code:
‚Ä¢ Universities adopting for CS curricula
‚Ä¢ Mathematical verification of every operation  
‚Ä¢ Production-grade features (distributed training, GPU acceleration)
‚Ä¢ Growing community of contributors and educators

This represents a unique approach to AI education - teaching through building rather than black-box usage. Happy to provide exclusive technical demonstrations or educational impact data.

Best,
Fenil Sonani
