# Skip security checks that are false positives in our ML framework:
# B101: assert statements used for tensor shape validation
# B110: try/except/pass used for graceful backend fallbacks
# B310: urlopen used for legitimate model downloads  
# B404: subprocess import needed for distributed training
# B603: subprocess calls are safe (using sys.executable)
# B607: subprocess with partial path (using sys.executable is safe)
