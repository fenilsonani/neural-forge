# 📡 Distributed Training Guide - Current Implementation Status

This guide provides an honest assessment of the current distributed training capabilities in the neural architecture framework, documenting what's implemented, what's partially working, and what's planned for future development.

## 🎯 **Implementation Status Overview**

The neural architecture framework provides **basic distributed training capabilities** with a foundation for future expansion. Current implementation focuses on essential functionality with significant room for enhancement.

### **✅ What's Currently Working**

- ✅ **CPU Communication**: Gloo backend for basic multi-process training
- ✅ **Data Sampling**: DistributedSampler with proper data partitioning
- ✅ **Process Launcher**: Infrastructure for launching distributed jobs
- ✅ **Communication Primitives**: Core all-reduce, all-gather, broadcast operations

### **⚠️ What's Partially Working**

- ⚠️ **DistributedDataParallel**: Basic wrapper exists, missing automatic gradient hooks
- ⚠️ **NCCL Backend**: Implemented but requires CuPy installation and setup
- ⚠️ **GPU Communication**: Available when CUDA/CuPy environment is configured

### **❌ What's Not Yet Implemented**

- ❌ **Model Parallelism**: Tensor and pipeline parallelism are placeholder only
- ❌ **Distributed Checkpointing**: Not implemented beyond basic interface
- ❌ **Advanced Fault Tolerance**: No automatic recovery or monitoring
- ❌ **Dynamic Scaling**: No support for elastic training

## 🧠 **Core Distributed Training Concepts**

### **1. Data Parallel Training (Basic Implementation)**

**Data Parallelism** replicates the model across multiple devices and splits data batches. Current implementation provides basic functionality:

```python
from neural_arch.distributed import DistributedDataParallel, init_process_group

# Initialize distributed training (CPU backend recommended for now)
init_process_group(backend="gloo")  # Use "nccl" only if CuPy is installed

# Wrap your model for distributed training
model = MyTransformerModel()
ddp_model = DistributedDataParallel(model)

# Training loop - gradients manually synchronized
for batch in dataloader:
    output = ddp_model(batch)
    loss = criterion(output, targets)
    loss.backward()  
    ddp_model.sync_gradients()  # Manual sync required currently
    optimizer.step()
```

> **Note**: Automatic gradient synchronization hooks are not fully implemented. Manual synchronization is required.

### **2. Communication Backends**

#### **Gloo Backend (CPU - Fully Working)**
```python
# Recommended backend for CPU training
init_process_group(
    backend="gloo",
    init_method="env://",
    world_size=4,
    rank=0
)
```

#### **NCCL Backend (GPU - Requires Setup)**
```python
# Requires CuPy installation: pip install cupy-cuda11x or cupy-cuda12x
# Only works if CUDA and CuPy are properly configured
init_process_group(
    backend="nccl",
    init_method="env://",
    world_size=8,  # Total number of processes
    rank=0         # Current process rank
)
```

> **Important**: NCCL backend requires CuPy to be installed. Without it, you'll get an import error.

### **3. Distributed Data Loading (Fully Working)**

**DistributedSampler** partitions datasets across processes and is fully functional:

```python
from neural_arch.distributed import DistributedSampler

# Create distributed sampler - this works correctly
sampler = DistributedSampler(
    dataset_size=len(dataset),  # Pass dataset size, not dataset object
    num_replicas=world_size,
    rank=rank,
    shuffle=True
)

# Use with your data loading logic
for epoch in range(num_epochs):
    sampler.set_epoch(epoch)  # Ensures different shuffling per epoch
    
    for idx in sampler:
        # Load data at index `idx`
        batch = dataset[idx]
        # ... training loop
```

> **Note**: The DistributedSampler is one of the most reliable components and works correctly for data partitioning.

## ⚡ **Launching Distributed Training**

### **1. Single-Node Multi-Process Training**

Launch training across multiple processes on one machine:

```bash
# Using the distributed launcher (CPU backend recommended)
python -m neural_arch.distributed.launcher \
    train.py \
    --nproc_per_node=4 \
    --nnodes=1 \
    --master_addr=localhost \
    --master_port=29500 \
    --backend=gloo
```

**Python API:**
```python
from neural_arch.distributed import launch_distributed_training

# Launch programmatically
launch_distributed_training(
    "train.py",
    nproc_per_node=4,    # 4 processes
    nnodes=1,            # Single node
    backend="gloo",     # CPU backend
    # Script arguments
    "--model", "transformer",
    "--batch_size", "32"
)
```

> **Note**: GPU support requires proper CuPy installation. Start with CPU backend for testing.

### **2. Multi-Node Distributed Training (Limited Support)**

Basic multi-node training is supported but with limitations:

```bash
# Node 0 (master node)
python -m neural_arch.distributed.launcher \
    train.py \
    --nproc_per_node=4 \
    --nnodes=2 \
    --node_rank=0 \
    --master_addr=192.168.1.100 \
    --master_port=29500 \
    --backend=gloo

# Node 1
python -m neural_arch.distributed.launcher \
    train.py \
    --nproc_per_node=4 \
    --nnodes=2 \
    --node_rank=1 \
    --master_addr=192.168.1.100 \
    --master_port=29500 \
    --backend=gloo
```

> **Warning**: Multi-node support is basic. Network configuration and SSH setup are not automated.

### **3. Training Script Template**

Complete distributed training script template:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
"""Distributed training script template."""

import os
from neural_arch.distributed import (
    init_process_group, destroy_process_group,
    DistributedDataParallel, DistributedSampler,
    get_world_size, get_rank
)

def main():
    # Initialize distributed training (CPU backend recommended)
    init_process_group(backend="gloo")  # Use "nccl" only if CuPy installed
    
    world_size = get_world_size()
    rank = get_rank()
    
    print(f"Process {rank}/{world_size}")
    
    # Create model (device handling simplified for CPU)
    model = MyModel()
    model = DistributedDataParallel(model)
    
    # Create distributed dataset sampler
    sampler = DistributedSampler(
        dataset_size=len(dataset),  # Pass size, not dataset
        num_replicas=world_size,
        rank=rank
    )
    
    # Training loop
    for epoch in range(num_epochs):
        sampler.set_epoch(epoch)
        
        for idx in sampler:
            batch = dataset[idx]  # Load data at sampled index
            
            # Forward pass
            output = model(batch)
            loss = criterion(output, targets)
            
            # Backward pass with MANUAL gradient sync
            loss.backward()
            model.sync_gradients()  # Required - auto sync not implemented
            optimizer.step()
            optimizer.zero_grad()
    
    # Cleanup
    destroy_process_group()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

> **Critical**: Manual gradient synchronization is required. Auto-sync hooks are not fully implemented.

## 🔧 **Available Distributed Features**

### **1. Communication Primitives (Working)**

Basic distributed communication operations are functional:

```python
from neural_arch.distributed import all_reduce, all_gather, broadcast, ReduceOp
from neural_arch.core.tensor import Tensor
import numpy as np

# Initialize process group first
init_process_group(backend="gloo")

# All-reduce: Sum tensors across all processes
tensor = Tensor(np.array([1.0, 2.0, 3.0]))
reduced = all_reduce(tensor, ReduceOp.SUM)
print(f"Reduced: {reduced.data}")  # Will be scaled by world_size

# All-gather: Collect tensors from all processes
gathered = all_gather(tensor)  # Returns list of tensors
print(f"Gathered {len(gathered)} tensors")

# Broadcast: Send tensor from one process to all
broadcast_tensor = broadcast(tensor, src=0)  # From rank 0
print(f"Broadcast: {broadcast_tensor.data}")

# Reduce-scatter: Reduce and scatter chunks (ensure tensor size divisible by world_size)
world_size = get_world_size()
data = np.random.randn(world_size * 2, 3).astype(np.float32)
large_tensor = Tensor(data)
scattered = reduce_scatter(large_tensor, ReduceOp.AVERAGE)
print(f"Scattered shape: {scattered.shape}")
```

> **Note**: These primitives work correctly with the Gloo backend.

### **2. Gradient Synchronization Control (Limited)**

Basic gradient synchronization control is available:

```python
from neural_arch.distributed import no_sync

# Manual gradient accumulation (no_sync is a placeholder)
for micro_batch in micro_batches[:-1]:
    output = model(micro_batch)
    loss = criterion(output, targets)
    loss.backward()  # Gradients accumulate locally
    # No automatic sync occurs

# Final batch with manual synchronization
output = model(micro_batches[-1])
loss = criterion(output, targets)
loss.backward()
model.sync_gradients()  # Manual sync required
```

> **Warning**: The `no_sync()` context manager is currently a placeholder. Gradient sync control is manual.

### **3. Process Launcher (Basic Functionality)**

Basic process launching is available but without advanced fault tolerance:

```python
from neural_arch.distributed import LaunchConfig, DistributedLauncher

# Configure basic launcher
config = LaunchConfig(
    nproc_per_node=4,      # Number of processes
    nnodes=1,              # Single node recommended
    max_restarts=0,        # Restart feature not implemented
    monitor_interval=1.0,  # Basic monitoring only
    start_timeout=600      # Startup timeout
)

launcher = DistributedLauncher(config)
exit_code = launcher.launch("train.py", "--epochs", "100")
```

> **Limitation**: Advanced fault tolerance and automatic restart features are not implemented.

## 📊 **Usage Guidelines**

### **1. Current Usage Recommendations**

**Batch Size Scaling:**
```python
# Scale batch size with number of processes
base_batch_size = 32
world_size = get_world_size()
per_process_batch_size = base_batch_size // world_size  # Divide, don't multiply

# Learning rate scaling is experimental
base_lr = 1e-4
# lr = base_lr * sqrt(world_size)  # Conservative scaling
```

**Basic DDP Configuration:**
```python
# Basic configuration (advanced options not implemented)
ddp_model = DistributedDataParallel(
    model,
    # bucket_size_mb parameter exists but has no effect
    # find_unused_parameters parameter exists but has no effect
)
```

> **Note**: Advanced optimization features are placeholders.

### **2. Environment Setup**

**For CPU Training (Recommended):**
```bash
# No additional setup required
python your_distributed_script.py
```

**For GPU Training (Requires Setup):**
```bash
# Install CuPy first
pip install cupy-cuda11x  # For CUDA 11.x
# OR
pip install cupy-cuda12x  # For CUDA 12.x

# Then run training
XLA_PYTHON_CLIENT_PREALLOCATE=false python your_distributed_script.py
```

> **Important**: GPU support requires proper CUDA and CuPy installation.

### **3. Status Checking**

Check distributed training status:

```python
from neural_arch.distributed import get_distributed_info, is_initialized

# Check if distributed training is set up
if is_initialized():
    info = get_distributed_info()
    print(f"Distributed available: {info['available']}")
    print(f"World size: {info['world_size']}")
    print(f"Current rank: {info['rank']}")
    print(f"Backend: {info['backend']}")
else:
    print("Distributed training not initialized")

# Test basic communication
if is_initialized():
    from neural_arch.core.tensor import Tensor
    import numpy as np
    import time
    
    test_tensor = Tensor(np.random.randn(100, 100).astype(np.float32))
    start_time = time.time()
    result = all_reduce(test_tensor)
    comm_time = time.time() - start_time
    print(f"Communication test: {comm_time:.4f}s")
```

## 🛠️ **Troubleshooting and Limitations**

### **Known Limitations and Workarounds**

#### **1. NCCL Backend Issues**
```bash
# Problem: "ImportError: No module named 'cupy'"
# Solution: Install CuPy for your CUDA version

pip install cupy-cuda11x  # For CUDA 11.x
# OR
pip install cupy-cuda12x  # For CUDA 12.x

# If still failing, check CUDA installation:
nvcc --version
nvidia-smi
```

#### **2. Gradient Synchronization Issues**
```python
# Problem: Gradients not synchronized automatically
# Solution: Use manual synchronization

# Current implementation requires manual sync
for batch in dataloader:
    output = model(batch)
    loss = criterion(output, targets)
    loss.backward()
    
    # REQUIRED: Manual gradient synchronization
    if isinstance(model, DistributedDataParallel):
        model.sync_gradients()
    
    optimizer.step()
    optimizer.zero_grad()
```

#### **3. Model Parallelism Not Available**
```python
# Problem: Model parallelism classes exist but don't work
# Current status: These are placeholders only

from neural_arch.distributed.model_parallel import TensorParallel  # Placeholder
# Don't use these - they're not implemented
```

#### **4. Limited Multi-Node Support**
```bash
# Problem: Multi-node training doesn't work reliably
# Current limitation: Basic launcher, no SSH automation

# Workaround: Use single-node multi-process for now
python -m neural_arch.distributed.launcher \
    train.py \
    --nproc_per_node=4 \
    --nnodes=1 \
    --backend=gloo
```

#### **5. Performance Expectations**
```python
# Problem: Performance doesn't scale linearly
# Reality: Current implementation is basic

# Expect:
# - Working distributed data loading
# - Basic gradient synchronization
# - CPU-based communication
# 
# Don't expect:
# - Optimal GPU utilization
# - Linear scaling
# - Advanced optimizations
```
