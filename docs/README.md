- Cross-references use relative paths for portability
- Documentation includes implementation status notes where relevant

## Performance Claims Verification

**Note**: Performance claims in documentation (especially in advanced guides) represent:
- ✅ **Benchmarked results**: Based on actual measurements where implementation exists
- ⚠️ **Expected results**: Based on similar implementations (noted as "expected")
- 📋 **Theoretical capabilities**: For planned features (clearly marked)
