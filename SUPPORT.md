## üöÄ Quick Start Help

### Installation Issues

#### Problem: Installation Fails
```bash
# Try upgrading pip first
pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel

# Install from PyPI
pip install neural-forge

# Or install from source
git clone https://github.com/fenilsonani/neural-forge.git
cd neural-forge
pip install -e .
```

#### Problem: GPU Support Not Working
```bash
# For NVIDIA GPUs (CUDA)
pip install neural-forge[gpu]

# For Apple Silicon (MPS)
# MPS is automatically available on macOS with Apple Silicon
python -c "import neural_forge; print('MPS available:', neural_forge.backends.mps.is_available())"

# Verify GPU setup
python -c "from neural_forge import Tensor; print(Tensor([1,2,3], device='cuda'))"
```

#### Problem: Import Errors
```python
# Make sure you're importing correctly
from neural_forge import Tensor, Linear
from neural_forge.nn import Sequential, ReLU
from neural_forge.optim import Adam

# Not from the old package name
# ‚ùå from neural_arch import Tensor  # Old package name
# ‚úÖ from neural_forge import Tensor  # New package name
```

### Basic Usage Help

#### Creating Your First Model
```python
from neural_forge import Tensor
from neural_forge.nn import Sequential, Linear, ReLU
from neural_forge.optim import Adam
from neural_forge.functional import mse_loss

# Create a simple model
model = Sequential([
    Linear(10, 64),
    ReLU(),
    Linear(64, 32),
    ReLU(),
    Linear(32, 1)
])

# Create optimizer
optimizer = Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.001)

# Training loop
def train_step(x, y):
    # Forward pass
    pred = model(x)
    loss = mse_loss(pred, y)
    
    # Backward pass
    optimizer.zero_grad()
    loss.backward()
    optimizer.step()
    
    return loss.data

# Example usage
x = Tensor.randn(32, 10)  # Batch of 32, features of 10
y = Tensor.randn(32, 1)   # Target values
loss = train_step(x, y)
print(f"Loss: {loss}")
```

## ‚ùì Frequently Asked Questions

### General Questions

#### Q: What makes Neural Forge different from PyTorch/TensorFlow?
**A**: Neural Forge is built from scratch in NumPy for **educational purposes** and **complete transparency**. Every operation is implemented and visible, making it perfect for:
- Learning how neural networks work internally
- Research and experimentation with new ideas  
- Educational environments and courses
- Custom implementations without framework limitations

#### Q: Can I use Neural Forge in production?
**A**: Neural Forge is designed for **education and research**. While it has production-quality code (98% test coverage, type safety, performance optimization), established frameworks like PyTorch are recommended for large-scale production deployments.

#### Q: What's the performance compared to PyTorch?
**A**: Neural Forge focuses on **clarity over raw performance**. However, we include optimizations like:
- Multi-backend support (CPU, MPS, CUDA, JIT)
- Memory optimization with gradient checkpointing
- Operator fusion for common patterns
- Mixed precision training support

### Technical Questions

#### Q: How do I use GPU acceleration?
```python
# Check GPU availability
from neural_forge.backends import cuda, mps

print("CUDA available:", cuda.is_available())
print("MPS available:", mps.is_available())

# Use GPU tensors
x = Tensor([1, 2, 3], device='cuda')  # NVIDIA GPU
x = Tensor([1, 2, 3], device='mps')   # Apple Silicon

# Move existing tensor to GPU
x = x.to('cuda')
```

#### Q: How do I save and load models?
```python
# Save model
model.save('my_model.pkl')

# Load model
loaded_model = Sequential.load('my_model.pkl')

# Save just parameters
torch.save(model.state_dict(), 'model_params.pkl')
```

#### Q: How do I implement custom layers?
```python
from neural_forge.nn import Module

class CustomLayer(Module):
    def __init__(self, input_size, output_size):
        super().__init__()
        self.weight = Parameter(Tensor.randn(output_size, input_size))
        self.bias = Parameter(Tensor.randn(output_size))
    
    def forward(self, x):
        return x @ self.weight.T + self.bias
```

#### Q: How do I debug gradient issues?
```python
# Enable gradient checking
from neural_forge.utils import gradient_check

def loss_fn(x):
    return (x ** 2).sum()

x = Tensor([1.0, 2.0], requires_grad=True)
gradient_check(loss_fn, x)  # Compares analytical vs numerical gradients

# Debug gradient flow
x.retain_grad = True  # Keep gradients for intermediate tensors
y = model(x)
y.backward()
print("Input gradients:", x.grad)
```

### Platform-Specific Questions

#### Q: Apple Silicon (M1/M2) Support?
**A**: Yes! Neural Forge has first-class Apple Silicon support:
```python
# Automatic MPS detection
if neural_forge.backends.mps.is_available():
    device = 'mps'
else:
    device = 'cpu'

x = Tensor([1, 2, 3], device=device)
```

#### Q: Windows Support?
**A**: Full Windows support with:
- CPU backend (NumPy)
- CUDA backend (with CuPy installation)
- JIT backend (with Numba)

#### Q: Linux/HPC Environment?
**A**: Optimized for Linux environments:
```bash
# Install with all features
pip install neural-forge[gpu,jit,dev]

# For HPC environments without internet
pip download neural-forge
# Transfer and install offline
```
